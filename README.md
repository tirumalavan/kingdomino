# Kingdomino
Easy scoring assistant for the board game - Kingdomino (Winner - Board game of the year 2017)

This page is responsive and renders perfectly on mobile and tablets also.
If you - the person reading this, are a graphic/visual designer, feel free to make any visual changes to the page.
I've tried emulating the box art.

I haven't included scoring for any special rules ( like castles being in the center of the grid).
It's something I'll be working on in the upcoming weeks.
